## üß© Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- **Keybinding Conflicts**: If you‚Äôre experiencing keybinding clashes (e.g., with `open new terminal` or `VSCodeVim`), check out the VSCode keybinding settings and modify accordingly.
- **Performance**: If the extension feels sluggish, ensure that your system resources (CPU, memory) aren‚Äôt overtaxed by other extensions or processes.
- **Language Support**: We currently prioritize TypeScript/JavaScript. Some features may have limited support in other languages. Check the [languageExtensionMap](src/shared/constants/consts.ts) or tweak settings for custom file extensions.
