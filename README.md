## Just Code and Chill

ChatCopyCat isn‚Äôt about hype. It's your coding sidekick, sliding into the VS Code scene with a "do your thing" attitude. No sales pitch, just a nifty tool that's there when you need it, invisible when you don't. It's about keeping things real and your code flowing.

Add ChatCopyCat to your editor, kick back, and let the good code roll.

## Coding, But Cooler

This extension is all about the laid-back approach to getting things done. It‚Äôs there to make sure your code just... works with your AI chat.

- **Share Your Code**: Do it your way, or let the cat handle it. No fuss.
- **Keep It Light**: It's about using fewer tokens because sometimes less is more.
- **Add a Dash of Context**: Only if you want, though. Your code, your rules.

With ChatCopyCat, your coding sessions are as chill as a cat lounging in the sun.

## Features That Don't Fuss
- **Paste with Ease**: Get your code prompt-ready, or don't. No pressure.
- **Trim the Fat**: Minify? Sure, if that's your thing. (.py .ts .js)
- **Context, If You Care**: It's there if you need it, out of the way if you don't.
- **Know Your File**: It‚Äôs got a knack for catching file details, but only if that's your jam.
- **You Do You**: Customize if you want, or go with the flow. This cat's not judging.

## Keybindings
>`Ctrl+Shift+C` is your Swiss Army knife here.

- **Quick Copy**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Snags your code, adds some pizzazz if you're into that, and preps it for a chat.

- **Just the Code**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Grabs the code or the line you're on, no extras attached, with a touch of style.

- **Silence the Suggestions**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Got suggestions poppin'? This will shush 'em.

- **Clipboard Do-Over**: Double-tap `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Made a mess? Clean slate in under half a second.

## Settings? Sure, If You Want
For those who like to fiddle:

- **`chatcopycat.inquiryType`** - Flip this on for a bit of Q&A before the magic happens.

You'll find these in the usual VS Code settings spot. Just look for "ChatCopyCat" and tweak away.

## Keeping It Relevant
Right now, ChatCopyCat is all about choice‚Äîgrab what you need, tag it if you feel like it, and keep it simple.

- **[Future Brainwaves](ROADMAP.md)**: We're thinking of ways to make it even smarter down the road.

For now, whether it's a snippet or the whole shebang, we're keeping it casual and integrated.
