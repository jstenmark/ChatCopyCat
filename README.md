ChatCopyCat is all about smooth coding without the cloud AI complexities. It's a VSCode extension that respects your space and enhances your workflow without fanfare or intrusion.

ChatCopyCat isn‚Äôt about hype. It's your coding sidekick, sliding into the VS Code scene with a "do your thing" attitude. No sales pitch, just a nifty tool that's there when you need it, invisible when you don't. It's about keeping things real and your code flowing.

Add ChatCopyCat to your editor, kick back, and let the good code roll.

## Coding, But Cooler

This extension is all about the laid-back approach to getting things done. It‚Äôs there to make sure your code just... works with your AI chat.

- **Code Sharing**: Share on your terms, let the extension finesse the rest.
- **Token Efficiency**: Less token use, more coding groove.
- **Add a Dash of Context**: Only if you want, though. Your code, your rules.

Code as serene as a cat napping in a sunbeam, that's ChatCopyCat for you.

## Unfussy Features üé©
- **Paste with Ease**: Get your code prompt-ready, or don't. No pressure.
- **Trim the Fat**: Minify? Sure, if that's your thing. (.py .ts .js)
- **Discreet Context**: It's there, but only if you call for it.
- **File Awareness**: Subtle file detail recognition, by choice.
- **You Do You**: Customize if you want, or go with the flow. This cat's not judging.

## Keybindings üêæ
>`Ctrl+Shift+C` is your Swiss Army knife here.

- **Quick Copy**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Instantly captures your code, optionally adds flair, and makes it prompt-ready.

- **Just the Code**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Grabs the code or the line you're on, no extras attached, with a touch of style.

- **Silence Suggestions**: `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Quiets down those pesky suggestions instantly.

- **Clipboard Do-Over**: Double-tap `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Made a mess? Clean slate in under half a second.

## Settings? Sure, If You Want
For those who like to fiddle:

- **`chatcopycat.inquiryType`** - Toggle for a prefatory Q&A session for tailored functionality.

You'll find these in the usual VS Code settings spot. Just look for "ChatCopyCat" and tweak away.
